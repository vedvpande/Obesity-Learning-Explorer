## Product

Obesity Learning Explorer: For Students trying to understand obesity, strictly for educational purposes. Offers one simple place to look up, compare and understand obesity trends.

This is a learning project. It must NEVER store real patient data.
It does not diagnose or give medical advice; it shows a disclaimer.

## Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript (strict) + Tailwind CSS + React Router
- Backend: Netlify Functions v2 in netlify/functions (TypeScript),
  routed with config.path under /api/*
- Database: Neon Postgres via Drizzle ORM; schema in src/db/schema.ts
- Validation: Zod on every API input
- Auth: Sign in with Google -> verify ID token on the server ->
  HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax session cookie
- Bot protection: Cloudflare Turnstile (verified on the server)
- Analytics: PostHog (never send health data in events)
- Payments: Stripe sandbox only (test keys sk_test_ / pk_test_)

## Commands

- npm run dev start locally (netlify dev)
- npm run lint ESLint
- npm run typecheck tsc --noEmit
- npm test Vitest
- npm run build production build
- npm run db:generate / npm run db:migrate Drizzle migrations

## Rules (always follow)

1. Work in small steps. Explore -> Plan -> Code -> Verify -> Commit.
2. Never read, print or commit .env files or secrets. Secrets come
   from environment variables only. Update .env.example with NAMES only.
3. Every API route: validate input with Zod, check the logged-in user,
   and only return rows that belong to that user.
4. Use parameterised queries via Drizzle. Never build SQL with strings.
5. Write or update tests for every change. Run lint, typecheck,
   test and build before saying a task is done.
6. Do not add a new npm package without telling me its name, why it is
   needed, and confirming it is the real, widely used package.
7. Accessible UI: labels on inputs, keyboard navigation, good contrast.
8. Git: never push to main, test or dev directly. Work on a
   feature/<name> branch and open a pull request into dev.
